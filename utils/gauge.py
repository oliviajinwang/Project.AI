    otherwise a rare-positive-class model with a low tuned threshold (e.g.
    ~5%) can be labeled High Risk while still landing in a fixed 0-30%
    "green" band, which reads as a direct contradiction to users.

    scaled_red_zone_start) -- pass it for models whose reachable ceiling is
    well under 100%, so red stays a genuinely reachable zone rather than a
    band nothing ever renders in.

    axis_max caps the dial's top. On a full 0-100 axis, a model that can
    only reach ~30% paints ~70% of the arc red, so even a genuinely low
    result looks alarming. Passing a cap near the model's reachable ceiling
    makes the green/yellow/red bands proportionate to what the model can
    actually output, so a low result reads as mostly green.
